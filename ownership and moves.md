For system level programming lanaguage like c/c++, memory management is totally nightmare, That's why all languages after c/c++ always bring "garbage collector" with them, and free programmer from spending their time
on memory management. There is only one truth in the universe that is you never have free launch. Garbe collector bring great performance losses, because a significant computing power will allocate to garbage 
collection.

Rust make a smart compromise for this. It builds up strict rules for programmer about how to use pointer and manage memory, and the not free launch thoery still apply, that is the grammar of rust is obviously 
difficult to grab compare with other languages.
